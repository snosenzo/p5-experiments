## Hanging Lights with shader

This project began from me wanting to experiment a bit with 2D shader work and p5js to see what it would look like if I could mess around with different shaders easily with my existing sketches. It turned out to be a bit harder than I thought it was going to be, but gave me a good introduction to the instance mode for p5js and its limitations.

I'm incredibly happy with how well this project turned out. I really like how well it captures the feeling of the scene
